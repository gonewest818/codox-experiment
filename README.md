# codox-experiment

## Steps taken

1. `lein new codox-experiment`
2.  add `lein-codox` plugin to `project.clj` and configure output path

``` clojure
  :plugins [[lein-codox "0.10.3"]]
  :codox {:output-path "gh-pages"
          :source-uri "https://github.com/gonewest818/codox-experiment/blob/master/{filepath}#L{line}"}
```

3. add `gh-pages` dir to `.gitignore`
4. `lein codox` to make sure docs go to the right place
5. stage, commit and push

At this point we have a source project w/ codox. Next step, add a
submodule to hold the published docs. However ... as an experiment
let's try to have the submodule be this same github project but
checkout a different branch.

6. rm `gh-pages` from `.gitignore`
7. `rm -rf gh-pages` if there is codox output there
8. `git submodule add git@github.com:gonewest818/codox-experiment.git gh-pages`
9. stage, commit and push

This last series of steps checks out the subproject (which is a copy
of this one! we'll fix that next) into the directory `gh-pages` and
also adds a `.gitmodules` file to the parent.

Now we're going to configure the subproject to sit on a branch named
`gh-pages` which is a reserved name used by GitHub for project
websites.

10. `cd gh-pages`
11. Note: `git status` currently says "On branch master"
12. `git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages`
13. Note: `git status` now says "On branch gh-pages. No commits yet". However the checked-out files from step 8 are all still present and unstaged.
14. `rm ../.git/modules/gh-pages/index` and `git clean -fdx`
15. Note: At this point `ls -a` shows only a file named `.git`, and that file contains a single line `gitdir: ../.git/modules/gh-pages` as a reminder this is a submodule and the actual git configuration is above in the parent.
16. Note: `git status` now says "On branch gh-pages. No commits yet. nothing to commit"
17. create a file named `README.codox` with contents "This is `gh-pages`, the codox documentation branch."
18. `git add .` and `git commit -m "initial gh-pages branch"` and `git push -u origin gh-pages`

Now we have a second branch `gh-pages` with no parent, no history, and
a single text file.

19. `cd ..`
20. Note: `git status` says "On branch master" and a modified file `gh-pages` which represents the fact we've changed the state of the submodule.
21. stage, commit, and push to master

Now we have updated the master branch with an updated submodule. In my
experiments I noticed GitHub automatically recognized the `gh-pages`
branch and enabled GitHub pages publishing from that branch. However,
when I browse to https://gonewest818.github.io/codox-experiment/ I get
a 404 error because there is no `index.html` on the branch.

Next, generate documentation into the submodule.

22. `lein codox` to generate a set of docs
23. `cd gh-pages` and `git commit` and `git push origin gh-pages`
24. `cd ..` and stage, commit, and push

Now update the documentation

25. edit `src/codox-experiment/core.clj` and add a function including a docstring.
26. `lein codox`
27. Note: `git status` shows the modified source file *and* a modified `gh-pages` submodule.
28. `cd gh-pages`
29. Note: `git status` shows some modified html pages.
30. (Still in the `gh-pages` submodule) stage, commit and push
31. `cd ..` and then stage, commit and push
